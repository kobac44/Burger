## Usage

- Burger App is a resturant app that lets users input the name of their burger they would like to eat.

- The user submits a burger name, and the app displays it on the left side.

- After the "Devour Button" is pressed the burger devoured is displaed on the right and (for my app) prepared for trash, or deletion.

- The app will store the eaten burgers in the database.
